# MemFS

This is modified with the official `file system provider` example.

Use those commands to test the different `copy/paste` behavior in a virtual workspace with or without query or fragment.

- `MemFS: Setup Workspace`
- `MemFS: Setup Workspace With Query`
- `MemFS: Setup Workspace With Fragment`
